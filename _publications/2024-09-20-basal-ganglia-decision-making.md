excerpt: 'The striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, receives topographically organized input from the cortex and gives rise to the direct and indirect output pathways, which have antagonistic effects on basal ganglia output directed to the cortex. We optogenetically stimulated the direct and indirect pathways in a visual and a working memory task in mice that responded by licking. Unilateral direct pathway stimulation increased the probability of lick responses toward the contralateral, non-stimulated side and increased cortical activity globally. In contrast, indirect pathway stimulation increased the probability of responses toward the stimulated side and decreased activity in the stimulated hemisphere. Moreover, direct pathway stimulation enhanced the neural representation of a contralateral visual stimulus during the delay of the working memory task, whereas indirect pathway stimulation had the opposite effect. Our results demonstrate how these two pathways influence perceptual decisions and working memory and modify activity in the dorsal cortex.'
